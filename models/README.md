# models

Pretrained model weights used by the backend for inference:

- baseline traffic-only UNet weights,
- enriched (FiLM-conditioned) UNet weights.

These weights are loaded by the backend at startup and are not intended to be edited manually. To reproduce or retrain them, use the scripts in `training/`.
